Hello there!  
My name is Talissa Floriani, I'm an agronomist passionate for plants and genes. I got my degree in Agronomy from Santa Catarina State University (UDESC) and my senior year from University of California Davis (UCD). I'm currently a master's student in Genetics and Plant Breeding at the University of Sao Paulo (USP).
I'm funny, new to data analysis by Rstudio, I speak Portuguese as well as English and a little bit of Spanish. I'm a super fan of rock, pizza and a coffee addict. Here we are going to discuss about science, hobbies, tips, codes and other things.   
See ya!
