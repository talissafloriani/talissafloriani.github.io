Hello there!    

My name is Talissa Floriani; I'm a PhD student passionate about plants and genes. I earned my bachelor's degree in Agronomy from Santa Catarina State University (UDESC) and completed my senior year at the University of California, Davis (UCD), in the Gepts Lab. I defended my Master's degree in Genetics and Plant Breeding from the University of São Paulo's "Luiz de Queiroz" College of Agriculture, with a FAPESP thematic project on common beans at the Statistical Genetics Laboratory. Currently, I'm a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Department of Crop Sciences, with Professor Alex Lipka as my Principal Investigator. My work is related to genetics and plant breeding, with a focus on statistical genomics and machine learning analysis in sorghum.

During my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities, such as running or rowing, and indoors, I love to paint and create new things. I'm a super fan of rock, pizza, and coffee. Here, we will discuss science, hobbies, tips, codes, and other topics.    

Enjoy! :)
