Hello there!  
My name is Talissa Floriani, I'm an agronomist passionate for plants and genes. I'm currently a master's student in Genetics and Plant Breeding at the University of Sao Paulo (USP) - Brazil, so feel free to talk to me about this subject.  
I'm funny, new to data analysis by Rstudio, I speak Portuguese as well as English and a little bit of Spanish. I'm a super fan of rock, pizza and a coffee addict. Here we are going to discuss about science, hobbies, tips, codes and other things. See ya! :*
