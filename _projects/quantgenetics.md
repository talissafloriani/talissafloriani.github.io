Quantitative genetics is the study of traits that are influenced by many genes and environmental factors. These are traits that don't follow simple Mendelian inheritance, like height, weight, or yield in crops.  
You might be asking yourself, Why is she bringing something that I already know? The answer is simple: I believe that, in any field of expertise, if you want to become an expert, you need to start with the basics. 
You need to know so well that you can think and create more complex ideas. Just as with complex traits, everything began with understanding the simple patterns of inheritance. 

### A Brief History

Quantitative genetics emerged in the early 20th century as scientists sought to explain continuous variation using the principles of Mendelian genetics. I will discuss their complex relationship in later posts.  
Key contributors include:

- **Francis Galton**: Introduced regression and heritability
- **Ronald Fisher**: Merged Mendelian genetics with biometric data
- **Sewall Wright & J.B.S. Haldane**: Pioneered population genetics
- **Jay Lush**: Applied these ideas to animal and plant breeding

These foundations still inform plant breeding, GWAS, and genomic prediction today.

### My History With Quantitative Genetics

My interest in genetics and plant breeding began when I was very young, and I decided to pursue this field during my first year of undergraduate studies.
I quickly decided that I wanted to work in this field for the rest of my life. Still, it was during one of my master's of science classes on quantitative genetics that I realized I wanted to become an expert in this field, just like my last PI. By the way, the PI was Professor Dr. Antonio Augusto Franco Garcia.
He used to joke that essential formulas needed to be tattooed, and I did it lol. However, this is not the case. The fact is that during those classes, we used to make videos, because what better way to explain something than to explain it to someone else?

My colleagues and I performed two videos, which are available on YouTube, and you can watch them below:

### Why Is This Important?

Quantitative genetics helps us:
- Understand heritability and genetic architecture
- Predict breeding values
- Use statistical models (like mixed models and GBLUP)

This was fun, and I look forward to sharing more about my projects and theoretical ideas on my blog. 

Enjoy!
